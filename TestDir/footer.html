			<h4>concept of the "footer" in web design traces its origins back to the early days of the internet in the 1990s. Initially, websites were fairly minimal, often consisting of plain HTML pages without much visual structure. As layout conventions began to emerge, designers looked to print media for guidance—where footers had long served as a consistent space for contact details, page numbers, and publishing information. Early web footers borrowed this idea, typically displaying copyright notices, last updated timestamps, and perhaps a simple email address. Functionally, these early footers were static and offered little in terms of interactivity or design flair. They were largely an afterthought, serving more as a sign-off to a page than an integral design element.</p>
		
			<p style="text-indent: 20px;">As web development tools and user expectations evolved in the 2000s, so too did the footer. No longer just a spot for legal disclaimers or contact lines, the footer became a valuable area for navigation and user engagement. With the rise of CSS and responsive design, footers gained visual complexity and flexibility, often incorporating menus, social media icons, newsletter sign-up forms, and even embedded maps. In the mobile-first era, designers started to recognize the footer's role in user retention, making sure essential links were accessible at the bottom of small screens. More recently, footers have also been leveraged for SEO purposes, including internal links and structured data. Today’s footers are expected to be both functional and aesthetically consistent with the rest of the site, reflecting a significant shift from their humble beginnings.</p>
