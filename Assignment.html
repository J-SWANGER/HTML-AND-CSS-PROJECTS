			Their Love for Drama
If you’ve ever seen a Husky throw a tantrum, you know how theatrical they can be. Whether it’s refusing to go on a walk or protesting against a bath, they make sure you know exactly how they feel—loud and clear.

		<p> Huskies are unlike other dogs in the sense that they were designed to pull a sled in the arctic climate. 
		Huskies love the cold and will lay in the snow when other dogs would be barking to come inside. 
		The breed is very keen on pecking order and looks to acquire dominance and position in their role.
		Most huskies are super playful and very energetic. This makes them easily bored with old toys and 
		prone to escaping if left in a yard or see an open door or window. These escape artists love to run and 
		will give you a workout when you try to bring them back home.
