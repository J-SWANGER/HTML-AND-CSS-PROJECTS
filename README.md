# HTML-AND-CSS-PROJECTS
<H2>This repository is for my Tech Academy projects.</H2>
<p>This repository will contain works done to showcase understanding of coding and ability to organize projects. This repository will also be for demonstrating the mastery of using Github.This will surely be a bit rough as this is my first true GITHUB assignment. My goal of this is to become very versatile in using Github and become a source of good information/knowledge as well. </p>
